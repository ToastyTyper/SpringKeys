# SpringKeys
A typing program using physics Hooks law for positioning. 

## Features
- Graphical Chaos Simulator.
- - Bad input leads to visual distructions and 'letter anger', where they get steamy mad and jumpy if you press them wrong.
- - Spring like behavior. For example a line return to scroll the window would make the top row have ballistic launchs. A launch uses a long spring nomal distance.
