# SpringKeys
Typing Tutor program using Hooks law for positioning chaos. 

## Features
- Graphical Chaos Simulator.
- - Bad input leads to visual distructions and 'letter anger', where they get steamy mad and jumpy if you press them wrong.
- - Spring like behavior. For example a line return to scroll the window would make the top row have ballistic launchs. A launch uses a long spring nomal distance.
    

TODO A typing tutor experience unlike any other! This project aims to reinvent the terminal-based typing practice by introducing dynamic character movement, fluid animations, and engaging visuals.

Key Features
Characters with a Life of Their Own: Characters spring and drift within a network graph, creating a visually intriguing and interactive environment.
Physics-Driven Interactions: Explore a unique way to engage with text through physics-based character behavior.
Smooth Animations and Visual Feedback: Enjoy fluid transitions and subtle cues that enhance the typing experience.
Typing Test Essentials: Track your WPM (words per minute), accuracy, and other metrics to track your progress.
Rust at the Core: Built with Rust for performance, safety, and cross-platform compatibility.
Graphics Exploration: Experimenting with visual techniques (wasm3 or three.js) to push the boundaries of terminal-based interfaces.
